<span style="font-size:0.5em;">
Born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, Alex graduated from the Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas with a B.S. He then joined the Department of Biological Engineering at the MIT for his graduate studies. As part of his Ph.D. in Leona Samson's Laboratory, Alex tried to answer the question: why do some individuals develop cancer and degenerative disease while others remain healthy? Alex then joined Gene Yeo’s laboratory at UCSD as a postdoctoral fellow where he worked in understanding the effect of nucleic acid damage on RNA Binding Protein (RBP) biology during the development of neurodegenerative diseases as well as in Autism and Cancer treatment. Alex deeply enjoys mentoring and has done so at all stages of his career. He believes that his own mentors played a very important part in his training and development as a person and a scientist and that he wouldn’t be where he is right now without their help, support and patience.

<span style="font-size:0.83em;">
Ebony Michelle Argaez is a 1st year PhD student at the University of California San Diego Biological Sciences Program. She is interested in studying the origin of diversity, how genes are expressed during development, what genetic mechanisms are conserved and how they evolve to create novel structures. At the University of Maryland, Ebony received her BS degree in Biological Sciences and BA in French Language & Literature as well as her MSc in Entomology. For her MSc she was assessing the effectiveness and risk of RNA interference implementation in the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. She looks forward to working with CASAs to promote cultural awareness and provide a stronger and supportive community to underrepresented minorities.
