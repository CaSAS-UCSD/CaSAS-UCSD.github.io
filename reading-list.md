Ebony Michelle Argaez is a 1st year PhD student at the University of California San Diego Biological Sciences Program. She is interested in studying the origin of diversity, how genes are expressed during development, what genetic mechanisms are conserved and how they evolve to create novel structures. At the University of Maryland, Ebony received her BS degree in Biological Sciences and BA in French Language & Literature as well as her MSc in Entomology. For her MSc she was assessing the effectiveness and risk of RNA interference implementation in the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. She looks forward to working with CASAs to promote cultural awareness and provide a stronger and supportive community to underrepresented minorities.
