<p>CaSAS (Community and Science Advancements in Spanish) is a STEM research 
seminar series at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) whose goal 
is to promote science dissemination in Spanish for the UCSD and the San Diego 
/ Baja California scientific community at large.</p>

<p>As an emerging Hispanic serving institution, UCSD has over 23% undergraduate 
full-time LatinX students as well as numerous LatinX members at all levels. 
Many of these individuals grew up in Spanish-English bilingual households, yet 
high level scientific knowledge and interactions occur almost exclusively in 
English. Likewise, UCSD has a large population of international students who come 
from Spanish-speaking countries where most of their education took place in 
Spanish but once arriving to the US, scientific dissemination takes place in 
English. Building and maintaining trust between scientists and underserved communities 
is a critical component of ensuring that the public benefits from research improving 
healthcare outcomes.</p>

<p>CaSAS was formed to serve as a scientific and networking space where Spanish 
speakers will be able to have high level scientific conversations in Spanish. The 
goal is to create a sense of community within the School of Biological Science and 
greater scientific community as we foster a sense of belonging and inclusion for 
our Spanish-speaking community members. This will help to break down barriers and 
stigma surrounding science and research by making it more accessible and relatable 
to individuals who would otherwise never gain access due to the language barrier.</p>
